# Pi Discord Bot
![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/license/yak-fumblepack/pi?style=plastic)


An academics focused discord bot that is aimed at helping students with an interest in STEM to succeed. Can pull problems from the AOPS wiki, run code, and much more. 

Supported Contests include: 
- AMC 10 & 12
- AIME
- USAMO
- USAJMO

Here is a [link](https://github.com/yak-fumblepack/mathcontests) to the repo containing all of the latex files, png files, and text files to the contest problems. 


**Update - 2021-01-21: New problem points system introduced. Improved help command documentation**

### Build
Clone the repo, `https://github.com/yak-fumblepack/pi.git`, and if you would like to use my other repo containing all the solutions for the contest, don't change anything within `contestproblems.py`. It would help to create a `.env` file to hold all of your secrets. The only secret needed here is the bot token. 

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all of the packages needed for this project. Python 3.8 is recommended.

That's all you need to host the bot locally, but if you do want to host it 24/7, here are a few links that might help.
